This repository was created to centralize material used to study for CJE certification. 
Each section will be worked separately and explore sample questions.

[Here](./cje_study_guide.pdf) is the full study-guide, so you can explore by yourself.

The CCJE certification is organized in 4 sections:
* [Key CI/CD/Jenkins concepts](./sections/01_concepts.md)
* Jenkins usage
* Building Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines
* CD-as-code best practices
